# RedguardUI
Configuration tool for The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard

Redguard's launcher that includes the configuration screen requires the game to be installed (registry check). While the configuration file is easy to edit, it lacks guidelines. This tool is meant to mimic the said options screen for easier editing.

**IMPORTANT**: Not tested thoroughly, make copies of SYSTEM.INI in case something goes wrong. Sound configs are safe.

Requires .NET Core 3.1 to run (sorry).

## Installation
Just drop the RedguardUI.exe and RedguardUI.dll files in the main directory. Sound configuration is done with SETSOUND program so that section is there just for show.

## To-Do
- Make it more WPF-esque
- More cleanup
